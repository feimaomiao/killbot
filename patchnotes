Hello! Killbot is just updated.
`release 2.2.0`
- - - -
•	Formatting some code
•	Now update message will be manual as heroku restarting their server fucks me up daily
•	Fixed a possible problem from jsonbox that could lead to `AttributeError` *and* `TypeError`
•	Fixed a long uptime and respondtime while offline members are being loaded when the bot doesnt `actually` track any member data
•	Re-uploading the code to github(after a week lol)
